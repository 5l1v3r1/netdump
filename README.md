## help

Says where to look for help:
```
netdump [help]
```

## show

### show target

List targets from file '/etc/netdump/targets.conf':
```
netdump show target [| more]
```

### show auth

List crendentials file '/etc/netdump/auths.conf':
```
netdump show auth [| more]
```

### show dump

List dumps for 'target' (case sensitive) created 'days' 
before/after (+/-) until today:
```
netdump show dump target [+/-days] [| more]
```

### show commit

List commits made to git control version repository
in '/var/lib/netdump/git' for 'target' (case sensitive):
```
netdump show commit target [| more] 
```

The output include: commit id, date and comment.

Show the number of commits:
```
netdump show commit target | wc -l
```

Show the last 10 commits (could be a greater number):
```
netdump show commit target | head [-n 10]
```

### show diff

List all changes for all commits made to git control
version repository for 'target' (case sensitive):
```
netdump show diff target [commit1 commit2]
```

The commit1 and commit2 allow to filter the changes
to those made between commit1 and commit2.

**NOTE**: The commit1 must be older than commit2 or the output will be empty.

**NOTE**: Use SPACE to scroll output instead of ENTER.

# run

Remotly dump configuration for target with 'tag':
```
netdump [run|runmail] [tag]
```

**runmail** is the same as **run** but send an email with a execution report

# debug

Same as run with debugging:
```
netdump [debug|debugmail] [tag]
```

**runmail** is the same as **run** but send an email with a execution report

# clone

Make a copy of the last or a specific dump commited version of a target:
```
netdump clone target destination [commit]
```

**destination:** is directory (e.g. /tmp).
**commit:** if specified should be taked from the output of the **commit command**.


# Version Control (Git)

* Dumps versions are saved in: */var/lib/netdump/git* an available via [GitWeb](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitweb) (/gitweb) in the same server.
* Protect unauthorized access to GitWeb using [Apache Auth Module](http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.0/mod/mod_auth.html)
* Apache LDAP / Active Directory authentication [git/gitweb.example.conf](https://github.com/olafrv/netdump/tree/master/git)

# Cron Jobs

* An example of crontab is here [conf/crontab.example](https://github.com/olafrv/netdump/tree/master/conf)
* Cron jobs should run with **netdump** user and edited as follows:
```
sudo su - netdump
crontab -e
```

# Backup (Global)

This are the most important directories to backup outside from netdump server:

* /etc 
  * */etc/apache2*
  * */etc/netdump*
* /opt/netdump
* /var/lib/netdump

# Logging

* Output (Dump) from devices are saved in: */var/lib/netdump/dumps*
* Unfiltered expect output are saved in: */var/lib/netdump/logs*
* Netdump command output are saved in: */var/log/syslog*
* Cronjobs output are delivered locally by **exim4** MTA 
  and are available via *mail* client command in a 
  **netdump** user terminal session.
